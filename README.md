# ROS-based-Differential-Drive
_Robotics Club, IIT Delhi_
* This project aims at building a differential drive robot that will can operate via a PS3 controller or using the turtleteleop keyboard input using the ROS Kinetic. 
* For the PS3 part, two different codes are present, one for usb type communication and other one for bluetooth.
* The repository also includes the scripts for the GAZEBO model developed for the visualization of the robot.
* Python Scripts for the Computer Vision part are present in the repository as well.
* The Harr Cascade Classifier of the OpenCV framework of Python3 are used in the project to detect, recognize and track a person. New data given is entered using Machine Learning Techniques.
