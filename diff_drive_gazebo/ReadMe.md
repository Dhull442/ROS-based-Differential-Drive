This is the gazebo / Rviz model for our drive. Currently it interacts with cmd_vel topic and moves accordingly. You have to open
a teleop_keyboard node in separate terminal publishing values to rostopic in order for model to work. 


Next goal is to move the model using encoders values from kangaroo to run a real-world simulation.
